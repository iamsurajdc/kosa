Daily Practice,Old Students Struggling to Practice,Paul Fleischman,,,Don't use Dhamma to harm yourself
Kamma (Karma),Old Students,Bhikhu Bodhi,"Great Disciples of the Buddha”, pg. 374-5",,"There are some kammas so strong that their results cannot be resisted; they can only be lived through with patience and understanding. But since we do not know whether or not certain influences in our lives are the results of such kamma, or, if they are, how close they may be to exhaustion, it behooves us to strive against them. Apart from everything else, such striving has its own value. While it may appear in this life to be futile, ultimately it will bear fruit for our good. The immutable law of cause and effect ensures that no effort is wasted. Here, as elsewhere, the Dhamma urges us to set our face against every form of fatalism - that most enervating and paralyzing view of life - even in its most subtle guises. It encourages us to rise from our failures undaunted and ever ready to try again. Defeats there may be - bitter and heartbreaking setbacks in the battle against craving and ignorance - but the true follower of the Buddha is one who will never admit any defeat as final. Like an old and tried warrior, we must be prepared to lose every battle except the last, confident that by perseverance the final victory will be ours."
Kamma (Karma),Old Students,Author: Nyanaponika Thera,An Excerpt from “The Four Sublime States” Publisher: Buddhist Publication Society,,"What, now, is the nature of that insight? It is the clear understanding of how all these vicissitudes of life originate, and of our own true nature.
We have to understand that the various experiences we undergo result from our Kamma – our actions in thought, word, and deed.- performed in this life and in earlier lives. Kamma is the womb from which we spring (Kamma- Yoni), and whether we like it or not, we are inalienable “owners” of our deeds (Kammassaka). But as soon as we have performed any action, our control over it is lost: it forever remains with us and inevitable returns to us as our due heritage( Kamma-dayada). Nothing that happens to us comes from an “outer” hostile world foreign to ourselves, everything is the outcome of our own mind and deeds. Because this knowledge frees us from fear, it is the first basis of equanimity. When, in everything that befalls us we only meet ourselves, why should we fear?
If, however, fear or uncertainty should arise, we know the refuge where it can be allayed: our good deeds (Kamma-patisarana). By taking refuge, confidence and courage will grow within us – confidence in the protecting power of our good deeds done in the past; courage to performs more good deeds right now, despite the discouraging hardships of our present life. For we know that noble selfless deeds provide the best defense against the hard blows of destiny, that is is never too late but always the right time for good actions. If that refuge, in doing good and avoiding evil, becomes firmly established within us, one day we shall feel assured: “More and more cease the misery and evil rooted in the past. And this present life – I try to make it spotless pure. What else can the future bring than increase of the good?” And from that certainty our minds will become serene, and we shall gain the strength of patience and equanimity to bear with all our present adversities. Then our deeds will be our friends (kamma- bandhu).
Likewise, all the various events of our lives, being the result of our deeds, will also be our friends, even if they bring sorrow and pain. Our deeds return to us in a guise that often makes them unrecognizable. Sometimes our actions return to us in the way that others treat us, sometimes as a through upheaval in our lives, often the results are against our expectations or contrary to our wills. Such experiences point out to us consequences of our deeds we did not forsee; they render visible half-conscious motives of our former actions which we tried to hide even from ourselves, covering them up with various pretexts. If  we learn to see things from this angle, and to read the message conveyed by our own experience, then suffering, too, will be our friend. It will be a stern friend, but a truthful ad well-meaning one who teaches us the most difficult subject, knowledge about ourselves, ad warns us against abysses towards which we are moving blindly. By looking at suffering as our teacher and friend, we shall better succeed in enduring it with equanimity. Consequently, the teaching of kamma will give us a powerful impulse for freeing ourselves from kamma, from those deeds which again and again throw us into the suffering of repeated births. Disgust will arise at our own craving, at our own delusion, at our own propensity to create situations which try our strength, our resistance, and our equanimity"
Kamma (Karma),Old Students,Bhikhu Bodhi,"The Buddha's teaching on Social and communal Harmony, Page 5",,"Right understanding of the principle of Kamma has a decisive impact on one's conduct. When we realize that our own deeds eventually rebound on ourselves and determine our destiny in future lives, we will bemotivated to abandon defined mental qualitees and abstain from bad conduct. Instead, we will be inspired to engage in good conduct and develop whoelsome qualities"
Kamma (Karma),Old Students,Bhikhu Bodhi,"The Buddha's teaching on Social and communal Harmony, Page 14",,"...the Buddha declares that the essential factor in the creation of kamma is volition or intention (cetana), for it is the intention that imparts to the action its moral quality"

Anicca will surely prevail upon them and you will keep yourself in good stead in spite of all these difficulties., Anicca is power. Thorns in the way are inevitable.

Kamma (Karma),Old Students, Ajahn Sumedho,"Not looking for answers, not asking for favors from life
Intuitive Awareness 
",,"The freedom from suffering that the Buddha talked about isn’t in itself an end to pain and stress. Instead it’s a matter of creating a choice. I can either get caught up in the pain that comes to me, attach to it, and be overwhelmed by it; or I can embrace it, and through acceptance and understanding, not add more suffering to the existing pain, the unfair experiences, the criticisms or the misery that I face. Even after his enlightenment, the Buddha experienced all kinds of horrendous things. His cousin tried to murder him, people tried to frame him, blame him and criticize him. He experienced severe physical illness. But the Buddha didn’t create suffering around those experiences. His response was never one of anger, resentment, hatred or blame, but one of acknowledgment. This has been a really valuable thing for me to know.

It’s taught me not to ask for favours in life, or to hope that if I meditate a lot, I can avoid unpleasant experiences. “God, I’ve been a monk for thirty-three years. Please reward me for being a good boy.” I’ve tried that and it doesn’t work. To accept life without making any pleas is very liberating, because I no longer feel a need to control or manipulate conditions for my own benefit. I don’t need to worry or feel anxious about my future. There’s a sense of trust and confidence, a fearlessness that comes through learning to trust, to relax, to open to life, and to investigate experience rather than to resist or be frightened by it. If you’re willing to learn from the suffering in life, you’ll find the unshakability of your own mind.

In other words, don't say evil things about one another, don't misrepresent one another, don't say anything that will cause people to fall apart from one another. Don't start false reports about one another, and don't encourage them. Don't curse or yell at one another. Instead of finding fault with one another, each of us should look at his or her own faults. This is what's meant by anupavado. You can use this principle anywhere, whether you're ordained or not."

Access to Insight (BCBS Edition), 2 November 2013",,"Anupaghato: Don't allow yourself to hate one another. It's only normal that when people live together, their behavior isn't going to be on an equal level. Some people have good manners, some people have coarse manners — not evil, mind you, just that their manners are coarse. Physically, some people are energetic, industrious, and strong; others are weak and sickly. Verbally, some people are skilled at speaking, others are not. Some people talk a lot, some people hardly talk at all; some people like to talk about worldly things, some people like to talk about the Dhamma; some people speak wrong, some people speak right. This is called inequality. When this is the case, there are bound to be conflicts and clashes, at least to some extent. When these things arise among us while we live together within the boundaries of the same Dhamma, we shouldn't hold grudges. We should forgive one another and wash away that stain from our hearts. Why? Because otherwise it turns into animosity and enmity. The act of forgiving is called the gift of forgiveness. It turns you into the sort of person who doesn't hold onto things, doesn't carry things around, doesn't get caught up on things — the sort of person who doesn't bear grudges. Even when there are missteps or mistakes from time to time, we should forgive one another. We should have a sense of love, affection, and kindness for everyone around us, as much as we can. This is called anupaghato. It's a part of our training as Buddhists, both for householders and for contemplatives.

Mukhameans mouth or entrance. Mokkha means liberation. Sit close to your food so that your mouth is near liberation. Don't sit far away, or you'll have trouble eating. Sit close enough so that liberation is within reach and you can stick it right in your mouth. In other words, whatever behavior is near the ways of the religion, that's the behavior you should follow. To be near the religion means following the holy life. Lay people have their holy life, too, you know, just as monks have theirs. Lay people follow the holy life in two ways. The first is observing the first five of the eight precepts: no killing; no stealing; no sex — this is what makes it the holy life; no telling lies; and no intoxicants. This is one form of holy life, near the entrance to nibbana. The second way for lay people to follow the holy life is by observing all eight precepts."
Daily Practice,Old Students,"Karel Werner, Bodhi leaves No. 24","From Collected Bodhi leaves , Volume 1, BPE, BPS  Pariyatti edition, Page 342-344",,"Three roots of ill and our daily life The first practical steps
We must take care never to lose our first insight telling us that it is not the desired object that can bestow happiness upon us and that it is not the obstructing thing or being that is the cause of our tension, pain and suffering. Whenever craving or hate prevails, it will lead to deluded action in deed, words or thought and hence to further entanglement and prolonged suffering. To prevent the prevailing of both these roots of ill, we must constantly maintain our insight concerning their true nature. In doing so, we are in fact coping with the basic root of all ill, with ignorance.
Practically, we may proceed in the following way:
1.        Identifying:  First, we should identify craving and hate whenever they occur. That requires that we be constantly mindful and watchful as to the real motivations behind our deeds, words and thoughts. Usually we act, speak or judge in thoughts without actually knowing our real motives in the moment of performing the action. Later on, especially when a performed act has brought some disagreeable consequences upon us, we are more willing to admit that we were overwhelmed by a sudden attack of anger and lost our temper. 
Our separating ourselves from that emotion or tendency takes place in retrospective analysis only, i.e., when it is over and “we” are able to think again. This separation, which is additionally established, comes from a thought that postulates a fictitious subject being in possession of an emotion, but it is, by no means, an outcome of experience in the respective moment.
This proves that in the moment when we were acting out of craving, we just were that craving, and when acting out of hate, we just were that hate. Or better expressed, there just was craving or there just was hate- in both cases, of course, connected with ignorance.
If we, however, maintain observant awareness of what is, of what we are experiencing in a moment of a strong feeling of some desire, anger, hate, etc., then “we” are not that desire, anger or hate, but “we” are that observing awareness and we can identify the desire as a kind of craving, the anger as a kind of hate, etc. Such a state of mind is not completely connected with ignorance. The watchful awareness represents here a degree of true knowledge and hence no deluded action can result out of it.
2.        Pausing: This brings us to our second task. Whenever we want to perform an act, i.e., do something, to say some word to anybody, or to think, to draw a conclusion, we should first pause to see the motive of the intended act. Such a pause before the performing of an act would be, in fact, a natural result of your attitude of watchful mindfulness aiming at identifying the lustful or hateful state of mind whenever it occurs if we do succeed in maintaining it. But if we don’t, then our preconceived intention to pause before acting to see our motivation, may still help us to identify craving or hate if it is present. Many a suffering could be avoided if people earnestly tried always to pause for a fraction of a second to see the pressing force present in themselves that is driving them to do an unkind act, to say a harsh word, to condemn someone in thoughts.
3.        Quick reflection: If we succeed in identifying the real motive of our act just before performing it, we may utilize the gap for a quick reflection whether it is worth being performed at all or not, which is our third task. When we identify one of the two  roots of ills being the motive or driving force urging us to do this or that, we shall most probably leave the act undone, without being obliged to struggle with it very much.
When the desire, repulsion or hate is strong and persistent, even when cognized as such, we may use all our capacity of reflection and imagination to call to mind evil consequences of acting out of such a deluded state of mind. By constantly observing the  desire and hate as an object, and not identifying ourselves with it, we are sure to see how it begins to fade.

Daily Practice,Old Students,"C. F. Knight , Bodhi leaves No. 52","From Collected Bodhi leaves , Volume 2, BPE, BPS  Pariyatti edition, Page 287-291",,"Mindfulness- An all-time necessity 
The importance of mindfulness, or mental discipline, cannot be overstressed. “All that we are is the result of what we have thought,” says the Dhammapada. From our thoughts flow words and deeds of a kammic nature, the result of which (kamma-vipaka) is that all we are “is founded on our thoughts, is made up of our thoughts.” As our past thoughts laid the foundation for our present condition, so our present thought are further accentuating or modifying that condition.
Hence, the mindfulness of our thoughts is very important. It is mindfulness that will enable us to recognize the three roots of evil arising from basic ignorance. Greed, hatred and delusion are born out of our thoughts due to an ignorance of their potentiality to reflect on our own lives the very results we are projecting towards others.
It is delusion which in turn gives rise to fear, superstition, and intolerance on one hand, and on the other attachment, lust for sensual pleasures, craving and clinging.
It is from hatred that anger, malice and strife arise together with pride, resentment and revenge.
Greed is the source from which arises selfishness, avarice, covetousness, and lack of generosity.
These evils- greed, hatred, and delusion- first arise to consciousness as the thoughts of our mind, and later find expression as words and deeds. If we are mindful, it becomes most obvious that in the end we ourselves are the ones who suffer most from their arising.
This mindful self-analysis of our thoughts will enable us to subdue the unwholesome inclinations arising in the mind before they find irrevocable expression n words and deeds. In a like manner we should be just as conscious of wholesome thoughts and inclinations, and foster them. Also we should be conscious of the absence of wholesome thoughts and encourage their arising. Remember: “All that we are is founded on our thoughts, made u of our thoughts.”
