# Tomorrow's (Potential) Backend Infrastructure


## Dreamhost

Dreamhost offers free non-profit hosting:

## WordPress

- Dreamhost has WordPress hosting (if we'd like to continue with Dreamhost and consolidate services)
- It seems like WordPress may have more surface area than Drupal, if that's something we want to consider.


## Drupal

Drupal actually has a website for connecting non-profits to hosting:

https://www.drupal.org/industries/nonprofit

### Migration

- Outsourced:
    https://cms2cms.com
    ...exists. I'm not sure this is trustworthy.
- Doing it ourselves:
    https://www.drupal.org/forum/support/converting-to-drupal/2009-06-10/dotnetnuke-to-drupal
    ...seems easy enough. We can try it out on a staging server.


## Shopify

Shopify *does* offer non-profit discounts but they are not advertised. The Shopify pricing for 5 staff accounts is $80/mo, which is already reasonable even without a discount so any discount would be helpful.


## VidyaMantra

- How much are we paying for this? Their rates seem very expensive.
